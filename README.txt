This script goes through my gmail, gets the bodies of the mails, extract needed data about stock trading and stores it into .csv file.

NOTE: I am not the author of the part of the script dealing with Gmail API. I have found it on the internet on some guy's blog, copied it and modified heavily to fit my needs. Rest of the script was written by me.
